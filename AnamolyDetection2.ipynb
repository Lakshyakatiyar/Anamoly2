    "Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection as it helps in identifying the most relevant features that contribute to distinguishing between normal and anomalous behavior. By selecting the right features, the anomaly detection algorithm can focus on detecting deviations in those specific aspects, improving detection accuracy and efficiency."

It significantly affects the clustering outcome and the ability of DBSCAN to detect anomalies. Choosing an appropriate epsilon value is crucial, as it determines the density of the clusters and impacts the identification of noise points and outliers."
